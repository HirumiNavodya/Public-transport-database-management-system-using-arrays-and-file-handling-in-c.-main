# Public-transport-database-management-system-using-arrays-and-file-handling-in-c.-main

Project Objectives: 
Creating a file system that includes, Correct bus and train routes, Correct time tables , Simple booking system.
Giving ability to enter or change data and
giving ability to easily query data in the file system

Proposed Solution
  Our proposed solution is to create a file system using C language. This file system consists of two 
  main operations. They are inputting data (entering new data or changing already existing data) and 
  querying data. 
      System will have two main sections. 
        1. Buses
        2. Trains
      This each section will have 4 types of data components. They are,
        1. Routes
        2. Time tables
        3. Booking system
